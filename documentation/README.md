## Goals

The eventual aim for the indoor air quality monitor is to give homeowners a picture of the overall air quality in their home. Also to provide advice for determining if any problems exist and what are the typical sources of those problems. By determining the severity of the problem it will be possible to determine if they can fix a problem themselves or what experts they can call to help fix issues. Ultimately, once 1000's of monitors are installed in homes it should be possible to provide a comparison of the home with an average home.
