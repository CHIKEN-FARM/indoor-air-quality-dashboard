## Sensors
#### DHT22
It is important to get accurate and reliable temperature and humidity readings as a measure of indoor air quality.
This is also useful for making deductions about the cause of indoor air quality issues in conjunction with other sensors.

I am concerned with the consistency and long term reliability of the DHT22 sensors and the quality seems to vary depending on source. There are more accurate and reliable sensors available such as the SHT15 (5 times the price of the DHT22). A cheaper solution would be to allow the DHT22 to be user replaceable so that a bad sensor can be cheaply replaced. 

I suggest a 0.1" 4-pin female header such as :

#### TGS-2602
#### WSP-2110
#### MICS-4514

## Components
#### Pair Digital Grove Ports
#### Pair Analog Grove Ports
#### Switches
#### RGB LED
