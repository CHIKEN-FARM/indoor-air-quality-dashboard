#### Humidity
The foundation of good air quality in a home is controlling humidity, so measuring this is important.

#### Mould
A study of a random sample of houses in Finland found a moisture problem in 52% of homes and a mould problem in 27% of the houses.

#### Formaldehyde
During the period 2002-2004, more than 70% of all newly built or remodeled houses had indoor formaldehyde levels exceeding the national standard of 0.1 mg/m3

#### Dust
Several studies have identified house dust as an important route of toxicant exposure. Often levels of pollutants found in house dust, including compounds banned long ago, are significant sources of exposure for the general population, especially children.
