	  <h4>Externally Vented Central Vacuum</h4>
	  <br/>
	  <b>Air Quality Advantages :</b>
	  <ul>
	    <li>External venting means all particles not trapped by the bag are blown outside the house</li>
	    <li>Powerful suction means more stray particles are captured during vacuuming</li>
            <li>System is sealed which means after vacuuming the outlets are closed and no smells can enter the house from previously vacuumed dust</li>
	  </ul>	  
	  <b>Other Advantages :</b>
	  <ul>
            <li>Bags only need to be emptied once or twice per year</li>
	    <li>Less weight to lug around</li>
	    <li>Quieter when vacuuming</li>
	    <li>Simple canister design means one rubber seal to replace if it fails</li>	  
	    <li>Save money on HEPA filters</li>	  
	    <li>Large selection of standard fitting attachments, brushes, crevice tools</li>
	  </ul>
	  <i>Note: HEPA filtration is not needed with an external vent and only adds maintenance costs<br/>
	     Bags are recommended for Asthmatics because dust is contained when throwing out full bags<br/>
	     <br/>
	     A similar level of cleaning can be achieved with a central vacuum located outside the living envelope (such as in a garage).

	  <h4>Externally Vented Shop Vacuum</h4>
	  <p class='content'>
	  This could be the cheapest solution. Use a shop vacuum with an external vent port (also known as a blower).
	  Connect the vent port to an appropriate flexible tube, and when vacuuming place the 
	  tube outside the window.<br/>
	  Ensure that the vacuum is properly sealed - check for any air escaping by feeling around the vacuum canister and 
	  hoses while it is running to be sure there are no air leaks inside the home. 
	  <br/>
	  Keep the window as closed as possible only allowing space for the tube.

	  <h4>Medical / Remediation Grade HEPA Vacuum</h4>
	  <p class='content'>
	  This is the closest to a conventional vacuum.  
	  <br/><br/>
	  Mold particles are between 0.3 microns and 0.5 microns in size, so a vacuum which can trap particles
	  of 0.3 microns in size is needed. A vacuum where the HEPA filters meet the EN1822 standard is the minimum recommended.
	  <br/><br/>
	  The Nilfisk Industrial models are high performing vacuums used in medical facilities and by mold remediation companies.

	  <h4>Conventional Consumer Grade Vacuum</h4>
	  <p class='content'>
	  I do not recommend consumer grade vacuums, particularly where people have Asthma or other respiratory complaints. 
	  <br/>
	  The primary goal of these vacuums is typically not to clean to the highest standards.
	  <br/><br/>
	  Many of the consumer oriented design features can move air quality further down the list.
	  Easy open latches, retractable cords, tool storage
	  compartments, lightweight motors, quiet motors and blockage access panels.
	  Features which require additional rubber gaskets are not good because this introduces additional
	  points of potential air leakage.
	  </p>
	  <p class='content'>
	  The additional complexity of these parts makes cleaning and servicing the vacuum itself more difficult.
	  <br/>
	  This also makes it more difficult to notice when something fails.
