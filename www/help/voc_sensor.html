	  To grow, mold requires a food source such as leaves, paper, wood or dirt.<br/>
	  It also requires moisture.<br/><br/>
	  When actively growing, the mold will emit spores into the air. By cleaning with an appropriate 
	  vacuum ( see <a href='vacuums.html'>Vacuum Cleaner Selection</a> ). A thorough cleaning can reduce
	  the smell in the house and reduce the mold spores / dust & mycotoxins and may help the occupants 
	  feel better. Cleaning may help to find the source of the smell (with your nose) but it is unlikely 
	  to have any effect on the VOC / Sewer gas readings on the sensor.
