      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class='content'>
	  This sensor detects <b>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's)</b> and <b>Hydrogen Sulphide (Sewer Gas)</b>.
	  It is not specific enough to determine which gas is which, so some deduction will be required.
	  It is worth the effort to determine the source of high readings in this sensor since anything
	  it responds to would not be positive for good health long-term.
	  <br/><br/>
	  The most common source of VOC's in a home would be that produced by Mold. Mold produces VOC's
	  during its digestive processes and that would be an indicator of actively growing mold.
	  <br/><br/>
	  It should also be noted that basically everything this sensor can detect will be detected
	  by an average nose, but it can be useful to view the concentrations on the graphs so 
	  you can see how changes within the house affect levels (for example when opening windows and doors
	  can give an indication of the source of the pollutant).

        <td class='content'>
	  Mold can grow anywhere in the home where there is a source of moisture. 
	  Examples :
	  <ul>
	    <li>Leaky plumbing or baths / sinks / toilets</li>
	    <li>Inadequately / incorrectly vented bathroom fan</li>
	    <li>Incorrectly vented washing dryer</li>
	    <li>Water leaking into walls or roof during rain</li>
	    <li>Water seeping into walls due to leaking drain pipes</li>
	    <li>Poor sealing/flashing around vents or windows in attic or walls</li>
	    <li>Crumbling foundations or foundations with inadequate drainage</li>
	    <li>Inadequate height for concrete perimeter foundations</li>
	  </ul>
	  If there are no obvious sources a thermal imaging camera can be used to detect 
	  cold spots indicating moisture.

        <td class='content'>
	  Sewer Gas can enter a home through a floor drain, from a leaking or blocked plumbing roof vent, 
	  or (if the gases are in soil adjacent to the house) through cracks in foundations.
